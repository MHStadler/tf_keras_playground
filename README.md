# tf_keras_playground

A small repository to consilidate, and test my implementation of various deep learning utilities 

## Current Tools
 - Stochastic Depth, a technique to train very deep ResNets [1]. Early, minimal viable implementation available as keras wrapper (layers.StochDep) or keras layer (layers.ResDrop)
